            <p>Learning has long been regarded as the acquisition of information. However, at Dr Challoner’s Grammar School we firmly believe that learning goes much deeper than simply knowing facts: really successful learners display a range of skills, habits and attitudes that underpin everything they do. In order to foster these characteristics of outstanding learners, we have developed the Learning at Challoner’s philosophy based on the latest educational research, which underpins everything that goes on at DCGS.</p>

        <div class="About">
            <h2 style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color:#3498db;">Enrichment</h2>
            <p>
                The school seeks to enrich the learning of our students in many different ways. The range of educational visits is genuinely exceptional. For example, in Year 9, the whole year group spends a week away from Challoner’s taking part in a wide range of activities designed to contribute to their personal development. We also arrange an Enrichment Day each term to provide an opportunity for students to explore different ways of learning outside the classroom. With the freedom of a whole day off-timetable, ideas and themes can be explored in depth, outside agencies can be brought in to provide quality support and students can work in less formal groupings such as across year-groups. All these changes lead to a real can-do attitude and give the students opportunities to demonstrate different skills and to learn from others. The whole concept meshes in with our drive as a school to allow students to develop their learning habits.
            </p>
            <p>
                In their first term at Challoner's, all of Year 7 spend three days at UKSA engaging in a number of activities, with the aim of helping the students get to know each other. Between raft building, kayaking, sea survival training, yachting and a number of other events, this visit is lauded by the Year 7s as a highlight of their first year.

            <h2 style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;color:#3498db">Digital Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Today’s students are ‘digital natives’; they have grown up surrounded by technology and they instinctively know how to use it and gravitate towards it. As ‘digital immigrants’ who have adapted to using technology later in life, adults often see it as a distraction from learning or as a gimmick rather than a learning tool. At Dr Challoner’s Grammar School we see it as part of our job to help overcome this perception. Digital technology and the internet provide infinite possibilities for learning and the skills that students develop during their time at school will provide the basis for using it in the real world effectively and efficiently. With this in mind, we have developed a Digital Learning project which aims to empower both students and teachers. Starting in Year 8, students bring in their own iOS devices. They use them in a variety of ways both in class and at home in order to enhance their learning, for example, live internet research in class and mind mapping apps at home. Google Drive and Google Classroom are used to set and complete classwork and homework. This allows for a much more personalised learning experience. Some classes are trialling an entirely paperless approach. The safety and security aspects of these devices have not been overlooked. The school has incorporated a detailed online safety element into PSHE lessons and we have a robust sanctions policy for students who misuse their devices. We also support parents to understand the device so that they can effectively monitor their sons’ use of it and make sure they get the maximum learning benefit from it.

            <p>
                Sport plays a major part in the life of the School. All boys have two hours of Physical Education curriculum time each week, and we run an extensive extra-curricular programme which provides the opportunity for all boys to take part in some form of physical activity in addition to their two hours of curriculum time. We are constantly seeking to develop the provision for sport in terms of both competitive and recreational activities. Challoner's is noted for its sporting achievements. Our major sports are football, cricket, hockey, rugby, athletics, tennis and cross-country running. Inter-school fixtures are played weekly throughout the year. Our teams take part in all the major local competitions and a number of students regularly achieve representative honours at county, regional and national level. Sports tours abroad are organised on a regular basis; venues include Barcelona, the Caribbean and the USA.

            <p>
                The facilities inside the school play a major role in the development of the students in the school. With three storeys, one for a cafe, a place for the sixth formers to relax and congregate with one another. The second storey is the Learning Level, where sixth formers can learn and revise with one another. If the sixth formers, or any student of the school for that matter, wish to revise in a quieter environment with books and resources readily available for them, the Milton Library is the perfect choice, with a mix of dedicated I.T. or purely pen and paper tables to help anyone revise the way they want to, which is a clear example of the modern facilities found inside the school. The science labs offer a wide variety of specialist equipment for students or teachers wishing to perform any kind of experiment, from mixing chemicals to quantum physics. The two I.T. labs offer excellent equipment for stundetns of subjects from graphical design to programming. With seperate labs, both filled to the brim with techonology, one having Apple Mac's for graphical design, with all the necessary programs already there, any student can sit down and get straight on with their work. The other lab, which is equipped with chromebooks, is used for web development, programming and general use which allows students quick and easy access to whatever they need to get the job done.
